    <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating intuitive front-end experiences. When I’m not coding professionally, you’ll find me ... coding recreationally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before I became a developer, I spent years working as a filmmaker where I honed my skills in collaboration, while being a part of a variety of cross functional teams. That same collaborative spirit translates perfectly into software development, where I thrive in environments that bring designers, engineers, and stakeholders together to solve problems as a team.

      Outside of coding, I dabble in amateur cooking, where I treat each recipe like a problem-solving exercise (with tastier results). My love for hockey has reinforced a sense of teamwork and the importance of precision, both in sports and in development. Lifelong learning is my superpower. I’m driven by curiosity and am always striving to improve my skills.
